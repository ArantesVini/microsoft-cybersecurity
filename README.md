# Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate

My personal notes from Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate Course, available on Coursera

## About this course

The role of a cybersecurity analyst includes monitoring networks for vulnerabilities or potential threats, mitigating attacks on the network infrastructures, and implementing strategies for data protection. With 95% of fortune 500 companies using Azure, it’s critical for cybersecurity professionals to learn to protect data within an Azure environment.

When you graduate, you’ll have tangible examples to talk about in job interviews and you’ll also be prepared to take the Microsoft SC-900 Certification Exam.

The course is divided in 9 Courses:
- Introduction to Computers and Operating Systems and Security;
- Introduction to Networking and Cloud Computing;

- Cybersecurity Identity and Access Solutions using Azure AD;
- Cybersecurity Solutions and Microsoft Defender;

Each course is divided by weeks and days, for each course I create a folder, and for each week a separated markdown file, in each markkdown file I divided into the main topic of the day and the subtopics, such as definitions of concepts.
